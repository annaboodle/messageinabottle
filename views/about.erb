  <h2>May I Recommend</h2>
  <p>May I Recommend is a fortnightly newsletter about things I think are good. Each newsletter consists of an essay (approximately 500 words or less), some recommended pairings to accompany the essay, and a Thing of the Week. It is inspired by Robin Sloan's Year of the Meteor, the podcast Wonderful, and my own hubris. Season 1 of the newsletter has been picked up for a one-year run of 26 episodes. No word currently on whether or not there will be a Season 2. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here.</a></p>
  <h2>Message In A Bottle</h2>
  <p>Message In A Bottle (the website you're looking at right now) is the email subscription platform I built to distribute May I Recommend. It was important to me to have a fully analytics-free experience, with no indication of how many people are subscribed, who's opening it, or what links are being clicked on. I wanted my newsletter to feel tucking a carefully rolled letter into an old rinsed-out rootbeer bottle, corking and waxing it, and then lobbing it out into the ocean and waving goodbye. Who knows whose shores it will wash upon? Maybe someday they'll write me back, or maybe I write the letter for no one but myself.</p>
